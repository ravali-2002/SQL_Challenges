My Solution:
with cte1 as(
select *,sum(salary) over(partition by positions order by salary asc,id) s from candidates),
cte2 as(
select id,positions,salary,sum(salary) over(order by positions desc,salary asc,id) s1 from cte1 where s<=50000)
select sum(case when positions='junior' then 1 else 0 end) as juniors,sum(case when positions = 'senior' then 1 else 0 end) as seniors from cte2 where s1<=50000
